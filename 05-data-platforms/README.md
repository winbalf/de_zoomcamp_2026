# Data Platforms with Bruin - Yellow Taxi Data

---

## Bruin (Data Platform – Week 5)

Bruin config, DuckDB, and logs live under **`05-data-platforms/`**, not in the repo root. To avoid Bruin creating a new `.bruin.yml` in the root:

- **Validate from repo root** (recommended):  
  `./05-data-platforms/scripts/bruin-validate.sh`  
  This runs `bruin validate 05-data-platforms` using `05-data-platforms/.bruin.yml`.
- **Or run from the module directory**:  
  `cd 05-data-platforms && bruin validate`

You can pass extra flags to the script, e.g. `./05-data-platforms/scripts/bruin-validate.sh --output json`.

### Question 1. Bruin Pipeline Structure

In a Bruin project, what are the required files/directories?

- `bruin.yml` and `assets/`
- `.bruin.yml` and `pipeline.yml` (assets can be anywhere)
- `.bruin.yml` and `pipeline/` with `pipeline.yml` and `assets/`
- `pipeline.yml` and `assets/` only

**Answer: `.bruin.yml` and `pipeline/` with `pipeline.yml` and `assets/`**

### Question 2. Materialization Strategies

You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on `pickup_datetime`. Which incremental strategy is best for processing a specific interval period by deleting and inserting data for that time period?

- `append` - always add new rows
- `replace` - truncate and rebuild entirely
- `time_interval` - incremental based on a time column
- `view` - create a virtual table only

**Answer: `time_interval`**

### Question 3. Pipeline Variables

You have the following variable defined in `pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  taxi_types:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    default: ["yellow", "green"]
```

How do you override this when running the pipeline to only process yellow taxis?

- `bruin run --taxi-types yellow`
- `bruin run --var taxi_types=yellow`
- `bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'`
- `bruin run --set taxi_types=["yellow"]`

**Answer: `bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'`**

### Question 4. Running with Dependencies

You've modified the `ingestion/trips.py` asset and want to run it plus all downstream assets. Which command should you use?

- `bruin run ingestion.trips --all`
- `bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream`
- `bruin run pipeline/trips.py --recursive`
- `bruin run --select ingestion.trips+`

**Answer: `bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream`**

---

### Question 5. Quality Checks

You want to ensure the `pickup_datetime` column in your trips table never has NULL values. Which quality check should you add to your asset definition?

- `name: unique`
- `name: not_null`
- `name: positive`
- `name: accepted_values, value: [not_null]`

**Answer: `name: not_null`**

---

### Question 6. Lineage and Dependencies

After building your pipeline, you want to visualize the dependency graph between assets. Which Bruin command should you use?

- `bruin graph`
- `bruin dependencies`
- `bruin lineage`
- `bruin show`

**Answer: `bruin lineage`**

---

### Question 7. First-Time Run

You're running a Bruin pipeline for the first time on a new DuckDB database. What flag should you use to ensure tables are created from scratch?

- `--create`
- `--init`
- `--full-refresh`
- `--truncate`

**Answer: `--full-refresh`**
